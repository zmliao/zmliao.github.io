Hello, I am Zimu Liao. Now I am a PhD student mentored by [Dr. Rong Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kz2T3P0AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW&oi=sra) in joint program of [SJTU](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). 

My research interest includes **HPC** applied in **Computer Graphics**, with a particular focus on rendering, reconstruction and simulation. My goal is to empower agents to learn the physical world.

I was a member of the UESTC_404 team, participating in the ICPC and CCPC competition series.
